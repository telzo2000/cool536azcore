<br>
cool536azcore is a keyboard powered by az-core and Panda Micro.
<br>
The PCB and acrylic plate were designed by me.
<br>
I made the cool536azcore a keyboard with 36 keys and a trackball that you can use without moving your hands too much.
<br>
This keyboard has both cherryMX and Choc switches to choose from.
<br>
You can use CherryMX alone, Choc alone, or both together.
<br>
By giving choc to my thumb and cherryMX switches to my other fingers, I can type with a very comfortable posture.
